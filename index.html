         The Lax&aacute; &iacute; Kj&oacute;s is the centrepiece of one of the most stunning glacially forged valleys in southern Iceland. A narrow canyon splays into a gentle, peaceful, arable valley before cascading down the final falls and pools into the sea. This exceptional river and it's beautiful tributary can be reached within a 45 minute drive from Reykjavik.

        <p class="featured-text-dark editable"> The lodge, overlooking Pollabreida pool is simply one of the finest in Iceland and is more akin to a boutique hotel than a fishing lodge.
            The large wooden dormer opens out on to a veranda that allows a view straight down the river. Guests' are accommodated in their 
        own rooms with en-suite bathrooms. There is a large drying room also on hand for making the early start warm and comfortable. </p>

        <h3> 1. </h3>
        <!-- <h4 class="text-yellow"> Heading </h4>  -->
        <p class="editable"> The Laxá í Kjós is a first class salmon river with strong runs of grilse and some multi sea winter salmon in the 8 to 18lb range 
            and occasionally one or two larger than that. The Kjos has a phenomental July run of strong, large sea trout of an average 5 to 7lbs but with
        some as big as 14 to 20lbs. </p>  
      </div>
      <div class="col-3_sm-12 padded-2 editable text-light">
        <h3> 2. </h3>
        <!-- <h4 class="text-yellow"> heading </h4>  -->
        <p class="editable"> The Laxá í Kjós is the main river, orginating in lake Stiflisdalsvatn. Close to the sea, 
            shorter but prolific Bugda tributary enters. The Laxá í Kjós and Bugda are fished by 6 to 8 rods roating throught 3 or 4 beats. 
        </p>      </div>
      <div class="col-3_sm-12 padded-2 editable text-light">
        <h3> 3. </h3>
        <!-- <h4 class="text-yellow"> heading </h4>  -->
        <p class="editable"> There is also an extra fifth beat (The Meadows) that guests can fish on a first come first served basis. This extra water is an added 
            bonus and helpful if for some reason the beat you have drawn is not producing. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-3_sm-12 padded-2 editable text-light">
        <h3> 4. </h3>
        <!-- <h4 class="text-yellow"> heading </h4>  -->
        <p class="editable"> The rivers are ideal for light 6 to 8 weight rods, small flies, and notably hitched tubes on floating lines. The river whilst intimate and visual, 
            invites a longer cast in some pools and in higher water conditions, so many choose to take a switch rod of 11 to 13 feet </p>
