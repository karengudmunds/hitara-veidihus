        <h2 class="featured-text-dark">  the river </h2>
        <p class="featured-text-dark editable">
         Hítará river originates from the lake Hítarvatn in Hítardalur valley. The river runs through old lava down the valley until it enteres the waterfall in the middle of the valley. Below the valley we have the tributaries Stekká and Grjótá joining the Hítará river. This part of the river is called Hítára 2/Grjótá. Grjótá is sold as a special beat with a self-catering lodge with 2 rods.
            </p>

        <p class="featured-text-dark editable">
            After the junction the river is called "Tálmi" and is part of the main beat. Tálmi enters the main beat just above the main road to Snæfellsnes peninsula. Hítará river runs after that about 10 km to the ocean. 
           </p>

        <p class="featured-text-dark editable">
            The Hítará beat is fished with 6 rods from middle of June to middle of September. Our short season and limited number of guests creates high demand, so we encourage you to contact us in good time if you wish to come and experience Hítará river.

        <p class="featured-text-dark editable"> The lodge "Lundur" overlooking the scenic "Breiðin" pool is one of the oldest lodges in Iceland with great history. The lodge was built by the famous wrestler Jóhannes Jósepsson or "Jóhannes á Borg" around 1950. </p>

        <p class="featured-text-dark editable"> Jóhannes was the owner of Hotel Borg located in Reykjavik Parliament square. Jóhannes was fishing in Hítárá from 1940 to 1964 with friends. The lodge was renovated in 1996 and again in 2018 when guest rooms were built besides the lodge. In the lodge are large flocks of stuffed birds.  </p>
